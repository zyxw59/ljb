\section{Sentence Structure}
\Langname{} has a default word order of verb--subject--object. However, since
nouns are marked for case, the elements can be rearranged for emphasis.

\subsection{Coördination}
In \Langname, multiple nouns, or multiple verbs, can be chained together to
form a single element of a sentence, without any connecting words.

\paragraph{Nouns} Nouns in coördination have two possible meanings. In the
first meaning, the nouns can all refer to the same thing, providing additional
specification or description. In this case, all the nouns must agree in case
and number. In the second meaning, the nouns refer to separate things, which
together fill the role in the sentence. In this case, the nouns must agree in
case, but not necessarily in number, and may not appear in the dual number.

\paragraph{Verbs} Verbs in coördination also have two possible meanings. When
the first verb is imperfective, the verbs typically refer to actions or states
which are happening at the same time. Some verbs, such as {\ll n.ɗ} \qq{to do
slowly}, when used this way, have the effect of modifying the following verb.
When the first verb is perfective, the verbs typically refer to sequential
events, or states which result from actions.

\subsection{Relative Clauses}
Relative clauses are marked with the conjunction {\ll zəj}, which joins a noun
to a relative clause. In the relative clause, if the head noun fills the role
of subject or direct object, it can be dropped. Otherwise, an appropriate
pronoun is used to fill the gap.
